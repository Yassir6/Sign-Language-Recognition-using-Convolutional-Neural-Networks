# Sign Language Recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks

#### Introduction: 
Sign language is the only way for deaf people to communicate with other individuals, not all individuals can understand sign language. which leads to, deaf people having a hard time communicating with others.
## Project Scope
The goal of the project is to build a Neural Network multi-label classification to recognize hand signs language images. The model should receive an image with a sign language letter after that the model should be able to predict what the letter is.
## Data Description
The dataset was imported from the Kaggle website. the dataset contains more than 70000 sign language images, each letter has 3000 images. sign language letters images have been taken in different shapes, resolutions, lighting, and rotation.
## Tools
•Jupyter Notebook •Matplotlib •Numpy •Pandas •Sklearn •Patsy •keras • sklearn •tensorflow •Pickle
